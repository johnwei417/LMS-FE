This project repository is maintained in a git repository.
http://www.git-scm.com/

As git is decentralized, a server is required to make it collaborative. 
For this purpose we have chosen GitHub https://github.com/

The repository is currently hosted at https://github.com/FocussedFlyer3/thestandardsproject

Git does not implement locking out portions of the repository, thus it is the responsibility of the developers to communicate on the task each member is working on.
